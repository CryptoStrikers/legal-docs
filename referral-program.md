# CryptoStrikers Referral Program Terms
Last Updated: June 8, 2018

The CryptoStrikers Referral Program (“The Program”) allows registered CryptoStrikers users (each a “User”) to earn free cards (“Award Cards”) and qualify for Ethereum payments (‘Referral Bonuses’’) by referring friends and other users to register and use CryptoStrikers.

To be eligible for The Program, a User must purchase a minimum of 1 pack of cards (‘Card Pack’).

To participate, eligible Users must agree to these terms, which become part of the CryptoStrikers Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and any updates made to those documents. Capitalized terms that are not defined here will have the same meaning given to them in the CryptoStrikers Terms of Use.

**How to Earn Award Cards**

Users can earn Award Cards if: (i) a referred person (‘Invited User’) clicks on their referral link to create a valid CryptoStrikers account that complies with our Terms of Use; and (ii) the Invited User completes a Qualifying Purchase. 

The referring User (“Referring User”) who invited the Invited User will be credited with a Award Card (consisting of Iconics set cards) each time that an Invited User completes a Qualifying Purchase. The total number of Award Cards that any User can earn is eight (8) cards.

**Qualifying Purchase**

A Qualifying Purchase is 1 Card Pack, paid for in Ethereum on the CryptoStrikers application.

**Redeeming Earned Award Cards**

Smart Contracts govern the management and distribution of earned Award Cards. When an Invited User makes a Qualifying Purchase, an Award Card will be transferred to the User’s account. The information relating to this transaction will automatically appear both on the Referrals section on the User’s Profile page, as well as, in the User’s Activity Feed.

Award Cards may not be earned by creating multiple CryptoStrikers accounts. Award Cards accrued in separate CryptoStrikers accounts may not be combined into one CryptoStrikers account. CryptoStrikers may terminate participation in The Program for any User that violates these provisions.

If for any reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding your earned balance of Award Cards, please contact us at referrals@cryptostrikers.com. CryptoStrikers may require you to submit additional information in order to make a determination regarding your balance. All decisions regarding your balance will be final and at CryptoStrikers sole discretion.

You are responsible for any tax consequences, if any, that may result from your redemption or use of Award Cards. Where applicable, CryptoStrikers may be required to account for VAT on any Award Cards that are redeemed.

**Referral Bonuses Qualification**

After an Invited User makes 8 Qualifying Purchases, the Referring User will accrue credit for Referral Bonuses. Qualifying Purchases will be tracked through July 15, 2018. Once the Invited Users brought to the Application by the Referring User have made 8 Qualifying Purchases, the Referring User will earn 10% of revenue generated from Invited User Qualifying Purchases during the period from June 11, 2018 to July 15, 2018, at 11:59 PM ET. 

Users can claim Referral Bonuses by clicking the applicable ‘Withdraw Bonus’ button on their Profile page starting whenever Referral Bonuses accrue. CryptoStrikers will send Referral Bonus payments in ETH directly to the wallets of Program Participants. **_Users who do not claim Referral Bonuses by this process by July 23, 2018 will forfeit them._** 

**Sharing Referral Links**

Referrals should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes, and only shared with personal connections that will appreciate receiving these invitations. Referral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the recipients are personal friends (such as coupon websites, Reddit, or Wikipedia). CryptoStrikers may terminate participation in The Program for any User that violates these provisions.

**Multiple Referrals**

An Invited User may only use one referral link. If an Invited User receives referral links from multiple Users, only the corresponding User of the referral link used by the Invited User will be eligible to earn Award Cards.

**Severability**

If any provision in these terms are held to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such provision (or the part of it that is making it invalid, void or unenforceable) will be struck and not affect the validity of and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

**Termination and Changes**

CryptoStrikers may suspend or terminate The Program or a User’s ability to participate in The Program at any time for any reason or for no reason at all.

We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove Award Cards or Qualifying Purchases if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive, fraudulent, or in violation of The Program terms and the CryptoStrikers Terms of Use. We reserve the right to review and investigate all referral activities and to suspend or terminate accounts or modify referrals in our sole discretion as deemed fair and appropriate.

**Updates to the Terms**

We can update these terms at any time without prior notice. If we modify these terms, we will post the modification on the CryptoStrikers website, which are effective upon posting. Continued participation in The Program after any modification shall constitute consent to such modification.
