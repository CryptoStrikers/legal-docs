## Help with CryptoStrikers

**How does Etherscan work with my CryptoStrikers transactions?**

Check out this overview video:

**I can’t get figure out how to get CryptoStrikers cards**

There are a few ways to get new cards. You can either buy a pack of cards, buy a single card from the Marketplace, or ask another user to gift you a card. You will need Ether to buy packs or cards - you can learn more about how to get Ether here.

**Can you recover my lost CryptoStrikers cards? I can’t access my wallet.**

Unfortunately, we cannot.

If you lose access to your MetaMask wallet, we cannot recover your card. It’s not an issue of it being against our policy or difficulty; it is simply not possible.

Our smart contracts secure each card so that our technical team can’t edit, access, or reassign them. This protects your cards from hackers and anyone else who would steal them. Unfortunately, it also means we can’t simply ‘recover’ any cards that you lose.

**I can’t sign up / log in from my computer**

Trouble signing in can usually be fixed by:

(1) Make sure you’re using the browser for which you downloaded the Metamask extension.

(2) Sign in and out of MetaMask before attempting to log in.

(3) If you’re using a different computer than the one you originally registered on, you need to copy your MetaMask seed phrase from the old computer to the new computer to ensure you have the same secure keys.

These steps solve login problems for most people, but if you still have problems, please contact us directly at support@cryptostrikers.com or on our #support channel on Discord.

**I can’t log in from a new computer**

You can use CryptoStrikers from multiple computers as long as you have MetaMask installed on both, with the same secure keys. When you log in to MetaMask on a new computer, it will request your Seed Phrase for verification. Copy your MetaMask seed phrase from the old computer to the new computer to ensure you have the same secure keys.

Don’t worry about your email or username. If you have the same secret keys on different computers, CryptoStrikers will know you’re the same user and show you all the same info (and your cards).

**I can’t log in from a mobile device**

If you are logging to our website through your mobile phone, only the Firefox browser for Android supports the MetaMask add-on. Please download either the Cipher Browser, Toshi, or Trust Walletmobile apps to access our website. For more info on how to use these apps, check out our mobile guide.

**Can you transfer my cards to another address**

First, we should explain that your CryptoStrikers username is linked to your wallet address. Therefore, we cannot merge addresses or transfer kitties, but the good news is you can thanks to the blockchain.

You can go to your profile page and gift any of your cards to your other address (the one you'd like to keep using) for free, just covering the gas fee that the Ethereum network charges for processing your transaction.

## Help with Transactions and Ethereum

**My transactions keep failing**

If your transactions are failing consistently for a long period of time, please contact us at support@cryptostrikers.com so we can further investigate the source of the problem.

**A transaction timed out but was successful**

When a transaction ‘times out’, it doesn’t mean the transaction has failed, only that network is very busy. As a result, CryptoStrikers won’t update until the transaction is finalized in the network.

This can occur because of low gas prices or a spike in network congestion.

**A transaction failed and took my gas fee**

Sorry to hear your transaction failed. Such is the nature of the blockchain as a decentralized platform; it’s also the reason why it’s so secure. When a transaction fails, unfortunately you still have to pay the gas fee.

For more info, [this article](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369) explains how the Ethereum blockchain handles fees.

**My transaction failed but I was charged. Can I get a refund?**

We’re sorry you’re having trouble with transactions. But unfortunately, there is no way for us to refund your Ether as we were never holding your funds.

CryptoStrikers is a series of smart contracts that run on a decentralized network - Ethereum. This offers the unique benefits of you being able to own your CryptoStrikers cards. However, it also means that any transaction you conduct is beyond our control. We are the facilitators and interface for you to interact with MetaMask and Ethereum respectively, but we have no control over the transactions being processed.

When interacting with the blockchain, remember that the gas price is the fee that the Ethereum network charges for processing transactions. Depending on the price you set for it, the transaction can fail or succeed, and the gas will be charged by the network for processing the transaction regardless of its result. We can think about it as the fee the users pay for attempting to execute transactions in the decentralized network.

**What is Gas?**

‘Gas’ is a unit used by the Ethereum network to measure how complex an action is. A transaction that needs a lot of gas is more complex for the network to process than a transaction that needs less gas. You don’t get to choose how much gas your transaction uses.

You can choose the ‘gas price’, which effects the total cost of your transactions, but makes them more likely to get processed quickly. Transactions in the Ethereum network are almost always processed in order of the most expensive first.

Read more about gas and its effects on transactions [here](https://ethgas.io).

**I didn’t receive Ether for a sale**

If you successfully sold a card, the other user definitely sent you Ether. However, since the user paid for the sale through our smart contract, the payment is not reflected as a typical IN/OUT transaction in Etherscan. To see the Ether generated from CryptoStrikers sales, check the Internal Transactions tab in Etherscan.

**I want to cancel a transaction... But it won’t work**

Sorry to hear you’re having trouble with transactions. There's an option to cancel the transaction on our website, but sometimes it's too late to do that since the transaction has already been sent to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Help with MetaMask

**Why is MetaMask being so slow?**

If you have a lot of tabs open, MetaMask will suffer memory leaks and slow down. To fix this issue, close all your tabs, restart the browser, and performance should improve.

**Can you change my MetaMask address or password?**

We are sorry to hear that you lost access to your Metamask account, however, this is something that we cannot help you with. Your CryptoStrikers username is linked to your wallet address, not to your email or username. That is because your cards are stored in the wallet, not our databases.

Read more about the nature of the MetaMask security [here](https://support.metamask.io/kb/article/28-abbu-always-be-backed-up-how-to-make-sure-your-12-word-metamask-seed-phrase-is-backed-up).

We understand this may be harsh news, so we encourage you to request support from MetaMask [here](https://support.metamask.io/new) to see if there's a potential solution. Unfortunately, your Seed Phrase is intended to be unrecoverable by nature, to avoid anyone else from taking control of your secure keys.

If none of the above has been helpful, please contact us with the details of your issue at support@cryptostrikers.com. Please include any relevant tx hashes, links, and card IDs so we can support you as quickly as possible. You can also check out our #support channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb).
