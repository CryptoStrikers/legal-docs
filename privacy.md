# CryptoStrikers Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 8, 2018

CRYPTOSTRIKERS LLC (“CryptoStrikers” “we” or “us”) believes that your privacy is a fundamental right. We have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to clearly describe what information we collect from you - and how we protect and use that information - when you use our internally developed smart contracts to own, transfer, and win digital trading cards (“Cards”) via interactions with our website (www.cryptostrikers.com) where the Cards are visualized (the “Site”). The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “Application”. 

By using the Application, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the Application, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the Application. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.

While our values will not shift, the Application may evolve over time, and this Policy may change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement on our site’s home page, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.

**Information Collection**

**Information We Do Collect**

We will ask you to provide us with your Ethereum wallet address and an email address. We store that information, as well as, the user name and profile icon you designate, the customer referral URL you create, and all transaction activity related to your actions with the Application.

We also collect basic analytics and log-in information when you use the Application. This sort of information may be collected from third-party providers like Facebook or Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the Application might be affected.

**Information We Don’t Collect**

We do not collect any other personally-identifiable information about you, unless you give it to us directly by filling out a form, creating an account, giving us written feedback, communicating with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicating with us via the Application or any other means. We do not collect any payment information from you, other than your Ethereum wallet address.

**Information Usage**

**What We Do With Information We Collect**

We use the information that we collect in the following ways:

* To analyze trends for how the Application is being used;
* To improve the Application;
* To help personalize your experience of the Application; and
* If you gave us your contact information, we will use it to send you data as part of making the Application available to you.

We may also use that information to contact you to send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts; provide general customer support; inform you about other products and services that we think might interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions.

We may share the information we collect with third parties who need to access it in order to do work on our behalf, including doing things like helping us make the Application available, or providing analytics services for us. We work hard to ensure that these third parties only access and use your information as necessary to perform their functions.

We will create aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information in a way that does not directly identify you. We may use and/or share those aggregations and anonymizations for a variety of purposes related to the Application, or our company and its business.

**What We Don’t Do With Information We Collect**

We do not share any information that directly identifies you with any third party, except in the following limited cases:

* As required to comply with applicable law or regulation, or to comply with law enforcement;
* To respond to claims and/or legal process;
* To protect our rights or our property, or to enforce our terms of use;
* To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;
* To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;
* With your consent, or at your request or direction; or
* As otherwise set forth in this Policy.

**How Do We Protect Your Information?**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

**How Do We Ensure That Our Processing Systems Remain Confidential, Resilient, and Available?**

**A. Summary**

We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available. Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt disaster recovery. We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**B. Learn More**

High Availability. Every part of the Application utilizes properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g. multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting availability.

Business Continuity. We keep encrypted backups of data daily in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data from these backups.

Physical Access Controls. CryptoStrikers is hosted on Google Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. Google data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics. According to the Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection. Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs, activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs. Data centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.” Company employees do not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.

Logical Access Controls. Company is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Company operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention. Unusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Company’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods. IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place. We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.

**Information Processing**

Depending on where you are located, your information may need to be transferred to different servers around the world as part of using the Application. Since we are based in the United States, any information we collect is governed by U.S. law. You acknowledge that, as part of making the Application available to you, we may transfer your information to or maintain your information on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and you choose to provide your information to us, you agree that we have the right to transfer your information to the U.S. and process it there. By using the Application, or by otherwise providing any information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of that information in and to the United States and other countries.

**Access to and Control Over Your Personal Data**

**A. Summary**


You can view, access, edit, delete, or request a copy of your personal data for many aspects of the Application via your user dashboard. You can also make choices about the Company’s collection and use of your data. You can always choose whether you want to receive marketing communications from us. You can also opt out from receiving marketing communications from us by using the opt-out link on the communication, or by visiting your user dashboard.

**B. Learn More**


Data Access. You can access your personal data on your account’s user dashboard.


Data Portability. You can request a copy of your personal data by submitting an email to us at privacy@CryptoStrikers.com and including “Please send me a copy of my personal data” in the “Subject” line. The Company will verify your ability to access that email, then send you a digital export of the data we hold that is associated with your email address. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14 days, but in all events within 30 days of our receipt of the request. The Company may be limited in its ability to send certain personal data to you (e.g., the identification of your Metamask wallet).


Data Erasure. You can delete your personal data on your account’s user dashboard. Please be aware that we require certain information about you in order to make the Application available to you; this means that if you want to delete any of these critical pieces of personal data, you may be required to delete your entire profile and no longer be able to access or play the Application. Alternatively, you may request that the Company delete your personal data by submitting an email to us at privacy@CryptoStrikers.com and including “Please delete my personal data” in the “Subject” line. The Company will verify your ability to access that email, then delete the personal data associated with your email address. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14 days, but in all events within 30 days of our receipt of the request.


Data Correction. You can modify your personal data on your account’s user dashboard. Note that since some of the data we collect is specific to you – for example, your Metamask wallet address – you may not be able to modify this data without needing to create a new user profile.


Your Communications Preferences. You can choose whether you wish to receive marketing communications from us. If you receive marketing communications from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that communication. You can also make choices about your receipt of marketing communications by signing into your account, and viewing and managing your communication permissions in your account’s user dashboard, where you can update contact information, manage your contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Company and our partners. Alternatively, you can request that we withdraw consent to use your personal data by submitting an email to us at privacy@CryptoStrikers.com and including “Please withdraw my consent for marketing communications” in the “Subject” line. Company will verify your ability to access that email, then update our systems to remove your email address from the system we use to send marketing communications. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14 days, but in all events within 30 days of our receipt of the request. Please note that these choices do not apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Application, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.

**Data Retention**

**A. Summary**

We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the Application, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. You can ask to close your account by contacting us as described above, and we will delete your personal information on request. We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.

**B. Learn More**

We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to make the Application available to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different types of data, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:

How long is the personal data needed to make the Application available to you and/or operate our business? This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the performance of the Application, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
 
Is there an automated control, such as in your user dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
 
Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.

Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.
 
Is the Company subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.
