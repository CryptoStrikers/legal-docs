# CryptoStrikers Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 8, 2018

CRYPTOSTRIKERS LLC (“CryptoStrikers” “we” or “us”) believes that your privacy is a fundamental right. We have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to clearly describe what information we collect from you - and how we protect and use that information - when you use our internally developed smart contracts to own, transfer, and win digital trading cards (“Cards”) via interactions with our website (www.cryptostrikers.com) where the Cards are visualized (the “Site”). The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “Application”. 

By using the Application, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the Application, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the Application. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.

While our values will not shift, the Application may evolve over time, and this Policy may change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement on our site’s home page, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.

**Information Collection**

**Information We Do Collect**

We will ask you to provide us with your Ethereum wallet address and an email address. We store that information, as well as, the user name and profile icon you designate, the customer referral URL you create, and all transaction activity related to your actions with the Application.

We also collect basic analytics and log-in information when you use the Application. This sort of information may be collected from third-party providers like Facebook or Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the Application might be affected.

**Information We Don’t Collect**

We do not collect any other personally-identifiable information about you, unless you give it to us directly by filling out a form, creating an account, giving us written feedback, communicating with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicating with us via the Application or any other means. We do not collect any payment information from you, other than your Ethereum wallet address.

**Information Usage**

**What We Do With Information We Collect**

We use the information that we collect in the following ways:

* To analyze trends for how the Application is being used;
* To improve the Application;
* To help personalize your experience of the Application; and
* If you gave us your contact information, we will use it to send you data as part of making the Application available to you.

We may also use that information to contact you to send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts; provide general customer support; inform you about other products and services that we think might interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions.

We may share the information we collect with third parties who need to access it in order to do work on our behalf, including doing things like helping us make the Application available, or providing analytics services for us. We work hard to ensure that these third parties only access and use your information as necessary to perform their functions.

We will create aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information in a way that does not directly identify you. We may use and/or share those aggregations and anonymizations for a variety of purposes related to the Application, or our company and its business.

**What We Don’t Do With Information We Collect**

We do not share any information that directly identifies you with any third party, except in the following limited cases:

* As required to comply with applicable law or regulation, or to comply with law enforcement;
* To respond to claims and/or legal process;
* To protect our rights or our property, or to enforce our terms of service;
* To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;
* To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;
* With your consent, or at your request or direction; or
* As otherwise set forth in this Policy.

**European Union Users**

Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:
Performing our services for you: In certain circumstances, we need your email address to provide services to you related to the Application and the Site. 
Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. 
For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so. 
We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users. 

**Information Processing**

Depending on where you are located, your information may need to be transferred to different servers around the world as part of using the Application. Since we are based in the United States, any information we collect is governed by U.S. law. You acknowledge that, as part of making the Application available to you, we may transfer your information to or maintain your information on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and you choose to provide your information to us, you agree that we have the right to transfer your information to the U.S. and process it there. By using the Application, or by otherwise providing any information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of that information in and to the United States and other countries.

**Information Security**

We take safeguarding your information seriously. We will take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. All that said, no method of transmitting or storing information over the Internet is completely secure. With that in mind, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

**Our Policy Towards Children**

The Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16 and you become aware that your child has provided personally identifiable information to us without your consent, please contact us immediately at privacy@cryptostrikers.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with their personally identifiable information, we will remove that information from our files.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of the Website after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.

**Other Websites and Services**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Site, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies.
